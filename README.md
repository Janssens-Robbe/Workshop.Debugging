# Workshop debugging

This solution is structed into 8 modules, each of them intented to teach you a topic for helping you debug your .NET application using Visual Studio. Besides "01 Basics", which should be finished first, you can take take the mudules in any order. Each of the modules has a assignment.md file giving you a basic guide on what to do. However you're not required to follow the assignment 1 to 1. Take your time to explore the tools and get used to using them.

You should be able to complete the first 6 modules in about 2 hours. 7 and 8 touch topics that are not usually used in daily development, so these can be skipped if you are time constrained.
