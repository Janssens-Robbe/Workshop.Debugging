# 1. CPU Usage
If you are develping performance critical applications, you may need to investiage slower processes from time to time. Using the build in CPU profiler in VS can help identify the slowest parts of your code. It can be used to identify which functions are taking the most time to execute.

To get started, follow the [ms docs guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/profiling/cpu-usage)

# 2. Memory Usage
Sometimes you may need to investigate memory usage. This can be done using the built in memory profiler in VS. It can be used to identify which objects are taking the most memory.

To get started, again follow the [ms docs guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/profiling/dotnet-alloc-tool)
